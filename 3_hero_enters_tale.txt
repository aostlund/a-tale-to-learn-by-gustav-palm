on the mystical island of Madagaskar lived the humble yet brave, and ridiculously fat Guybrush Threepwood. Guybrush had a certain sett off skills. One of these skills is the power of stopping time. Another was to eat a five-foot club sandwich in less than a minute!
Guybrush recently got from his mother a cloak with a printed lion on it. Also from his mother he had gotten his side kick. More known as his little brother, who had the skills of five-hundred nobodies.
